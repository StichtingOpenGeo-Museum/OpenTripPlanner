/**
 * A TripTimes represents the arrival and departure times for a single trip in an Timetable. It
 * is carried along by States when routing to ensure that they have a consistent, fast view of the 
 * trip when realtime updates are being applied. 
 * All times are expressed as seconds since midnight (as in GTFS). The indexes into a StopTimes are 
 * not stop indexes, but inter-stop segment ("hop") indexes, so hop 0 refers to the hop between 
 * stops 0 and 1, and arrival 0 is actually an arrival at stop 1. The main reason for this is that 
 * it saves two extra array elements in every stopTimes. It might be worth it to just use stop 
 * indexes everywhere for simplicity.
